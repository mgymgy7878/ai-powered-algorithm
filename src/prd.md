**Why it matters**: Democratizes algorithmic trading by removing the technical barrier - users can focus on strategy logic rather than implementation details.

**Success criteria**: Users can generate working strategies through natural conversation without writing code.

### 2. MatrixIQ-Level Strategy Analysis
**What it does**: Performs professional-grade analysis including market condition assessment, risk profiling, and multi-timeframe backtesting.

**Why it matters**: Ensures generated strategies are robust and suitable for real market conditions.

**Success criteria**: Generated strategies achieve realistic performance metrics and pass professional validation tests.

### 3. Advanced Code Editor with IntelliSense
**What it does**: Provides a Monaco Editor-based code environment with professional syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, error detection, and AI-powered debugging assistance.

**Key Features**:
- Full Monaco Editor integration (VS Code-like experience)
- Python syntax highlighting and error detection
- Trading-specific IntelliSense completions (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Auto-completion for strategy templates and risk management functions
- Real-time syntax validation and error highlighting
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+S save, Ctrl+E analyze)
- Line numbers, code folding, and minimap navigation
- Smart indentation and auto-formatting

**Why it matters**: Professional developers expect sophisticated editing tools. The Monaco Editor provides a familiar, powerful environment that accelerates strategy development while reducing syntax errors.

**Success criteria**: Users can write and edit code efficiently with fewer errors, leveraging intelligent completions for faster development.

### 4. Advanced Backtesting Engine
**What it does**: Runs comprehensive backtests across multiple market conditions, timeframes, and asset classes with detailed performance analytics.

**Why it matters**: Validates strategy effectiveness before risking real capital.

**Success criteria**: Backtests provide accurate, realistic performance projections that correlate with live performance.

### 5. Live Trading Integration
**What it does**: Enables seamless deployment of tested strategies to live trading with risk management controls.

**Why it matters**: Bridges the gap between strategy development and actual trading execution.

**Success criteria**: Strategies can be deployed live with appropriate safeguards and monitoring.

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Users should feel confident, professional, and in control - similar to using advanced financial software but with the intelligence of modern AI tools.

**Design Personality**: Clean, professional, and sophisticated with subtle financial industry cues. Think Bloomberg Terminal meets modern AI interface.

**Visual Metaphors**: 
- Chat interface resembling Cursor IDE
- Financial charts and analytics dashboards
- Professional trading terminal aesthetics
- AI assistant represented as knowledgeable trading expert

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional financial theme with blue primary, accent green for profits, and careful use of red for warnings.

**Primary Color**: Deep financial blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - conveys trust, stability, and professionalism
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue grays for UI elements and backgrounds
**Accent Color**: Success green (oklch(0.55 0.15 140)) for positive metrics and confirmations
**Warning Color**: Controlled red/orange for errors and high-risk indicators

**Color Psychology**: Blue establishes trust and professionalism critical in financial applications. Green reinforces positive performance. Red is used sparingly for critical warnings only.

### Typography System
**Font Pairing**: 
- **Headers**: Inter (clean, modern sans-serif for professionalism)
- **Body**: Inter (consistency and readability)
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono (optimal for code readability)

**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between AI chat messages, code blocks, financial data, and navigation elements.

### Component Selection & Behavior

**Chat Interface**: Conversation-style message bubbles with distinct styling for user vs AI messages. Include typing indicators and progress bars for AI processing.

**Strategy Cards**: Professional cards showing key metrics, status indicators, and quick actions. Use subtle shadows and hover effects.

**Code Editor**: Professional Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense completions, and integrated AI assistance. Features include real-time error detection, smart completions for trading indicators, and keyboard shortcuts for efficient coding.

**Financial Data Displays**: Clean, scannable layouts for performance metrics with appropriate use of color coding for positive/negative values.

### Interaction Patterns

**Conversational Flow**: Natural language input with intelligent parsing and contextual responses. Support for follow-up questions and clarifications.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple strategy generation, progressively reveal advanced features like optimization and live trading as users gain confidence.

**Contextual Assistance**: AI provides relevant suggestions and guidance based on current task and strategy context.

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability**: Architecture supports multiple concurrent AI conversations and strategy generations. Efficient state management for complex strategy data.

**Performance**: Optimized rendering for large code blocks and real-time data updates. Lazy loading for strategy histories and analytics.

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery with helpful AI-generated suggestions for resolution.
